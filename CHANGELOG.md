# Changelog

As of iOS 3.2.0 and Android 4.0.0, we've split the CHANGELOG into platform specific CHANGELOGS to make it easier to follow the progress of a particular project.  Their new locations are as follows:

* Android --> [`/platform/android/CHANGELOG.md`](platform/android/CHANGELOG.md)
* iOS --> [`/platform/ios/CHANGELOG.md`](platform/ios/CHANGELOG.md)
* Node.js --> [`/platform/node/CHANGELOG.md`](platform/node/CHANGELOG.md)
